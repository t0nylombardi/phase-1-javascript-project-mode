The unknown suspect then ignited the top of a gas-filled mason jar with fire and threw it into the temple, starting a fire in the main place of worship where a monk was asleep on the floor. The unknown suspect then fled the scene, and the monks that were sleeping in the temple extinguished the fire with no serious injuries.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

According to a friend, Hein showed up in Clinton, Oklahoma, and then in early March 1983, Hein hitched a ride with the friend's father to California. They stopped for the night in Indio, California. Hein left the hotel room and has not been seen or heard from since.

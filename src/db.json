His last communication with family members was in early April 1978 when he called an aunt, stating he was working on a shipping dock (possibly on the SS President riverboat) in New Orleans, Louisiana. Prior to his disappearance, he sent a postcard to his aunt from New Orleans saying he was doing fine. He has never been heard from again.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Doran was known to hitchhike, traveling across the country from California to Florida. He was a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, an avid guitar player, and liked to write short stories and poetry. He also carried a small pocket Bible with him. Fingerprints are available for comparison, and DNA from family members is in CODIS.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
